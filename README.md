TODO: **Work on If This, Then That Achievement**
- X Create an `index.html` with an accessible form
  - X add `<fieldset>`
  - X add `<legend>`
  - X use `<label>`
- X Add any fields of your choice, a submit button and one of the following:
  <!-- - a <select> menu with at least three options, OR; -->
  - X a list of radio buttons with at least three options, OR;
  <!-- - a single checkbox. -->
- X Using `Event.preventDefault()`, stop the form from refreshing the page when the form submits.
- X Create a conditional message or make a visible change on the page based on the value of the menu, checkbox.

I want to make a page with some pet options and whatever the user selects, it'll display a picture of that animal on the page.

Started by creating all of the HTML elements. Then added some mild CSS so that everything is centered. 

Started on the javacript and think I am starting to understand it a bit better. Still need help with the "If/else" functions but I'll find more info on it or a video to help me out.

Just spent an hour or two trying to figure out why `Event.preventDefault()` wasn't working. When I looked back at my initial statement. I guess at some point I deleted the 'r' and so it said `submitHandle` and so it wasn't working... 

I couldn't get the images to work so I added some text. But still got something done. Feeling a lot better about javascript.
